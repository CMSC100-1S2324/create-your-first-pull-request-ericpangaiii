Cocoy's Expectations:
- As a second taker of this course, my expectations of CMSC 100 remain more or less the same. 
Aside from the obvious end goal to pass, I just hope to experience the process of designing 
and implementing web applications as something enjoyable and fulfulling.

While passing the course is important, discovering joy and fulfillment in the web application creation process is where the true magic lies. 
I wish you even more exciting and enjoyable experiences as you progress."
